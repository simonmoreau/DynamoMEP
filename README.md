<h4 align="center">A Dynamo package for MEP elements</h4>

# Overview

DynamoMEP is a Dynamo package for working with MEP elements in Revit.

DynamoMEP is an Open-Source project available on github and Dynamoâ€™s package manager. The package started with nodes for creating room and MEP Spaces, and will be improved over time.

The project is being developed in C# using Visual Studio, and will work with Dynamo 2.0 and forward, and Revit 2016 and forward. The project mostly consists of zero-touch nodes with a few custom ones.
